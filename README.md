## Challenge 8.1:

The REPL no longer supports entering a single expression and automatically printing its result value. Thatâ€™s a drag. Add support to the REPL to let users type in both statements and expressions. If they enter a statement, execute it. If they enter an expression, evaluate it and display the result value.
