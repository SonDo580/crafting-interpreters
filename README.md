## Challenge 13.1

Lox supports only single inheritance — a class may have a single superclass and that’s the only way to reuse methods across classes. Other languages have explored a variety of ways to more freely reuse and share capabilities across classes: mixins, traits, multiple inheritance, virtual inheritance, extension methods, etc.

If you were to add some feature along these lines to Lox, which would you pick and why?

## Implement

- I will implement `multiple inheritance`
- Because Python has that feature, and I love Python :)
