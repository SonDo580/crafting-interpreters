## Question

Most Lisp implementations that compile to C also contain an interpreter that lets them execute Lisp code on the fly as well. Why?

## Answer

- For interactive environment: allow us to execute code without the need for compilation
- Evaluation During Compilation feature: allow us to write code to be evaluated during compilation (`eval-and-compile` and `eval-when-compile`)
