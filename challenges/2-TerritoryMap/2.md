## Question

Just-in-time compilation tends to be the fastest way to implement dynamically typed languages, but not all of them use it. What reasons are there to not JIT?

## Answer

1. **What is JIT compilation (from the book)**

On the end user's machine, when the program is loaded - either from source (in case of JS) or platform-independent bytecode (for the JVM and CLR) - the compiler compiles it to native code for the architecture their computer support

2. **Reasons not to use JIT**

- Implementing a JIT compiler is more complex => hard to develop, maintain, debug
- The compilation occurs at run time => increase the startup time of the application
- ...
