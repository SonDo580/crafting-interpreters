## Challenge 11.2

How do other languages you know handle local variables that refer to the same name in their initializer, like:

```
var a = "outer";
{
  var a = a;
}
```

Is it a runtime error? Compile error? Allowed? Do they treat global variables differently? Do you agree with their choices? Justify your answer.

## Answer

- In Lox, this is a runtime error.
- In JavaScript, it is allowed and print 'outer'. If we use `let` instead of `var`, this results in a runtime error (Reference Error), simlar to Lox.
