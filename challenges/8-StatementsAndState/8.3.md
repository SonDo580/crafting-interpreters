## Challenge 8.3

What does the following program do?

```
var a = 1;
{
  var a = a + 2;
  print a;
}
```

What did you expect it to do? Is it what you think it should do? What does analogous code in other languages you are familiar with do? What do you think users will expect this to do?

## Answer

- It prints `3` to the console. That's what I expected with Lox.

## Process

1. Global scope:

- Define variable `a` and assigned value `1` to it.

2. Inside the block:

- The expression `a + 2` will be evaluated first. The current environment contains no variable named `a` (yet), so the interpreter will search the enclosing environment and found `a = 1` => the expression is evaluated to `3`
- The value `3` is assigned to a new variable `a` in the current environment, which then used by the `print` statement
