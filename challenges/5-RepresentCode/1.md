## Question

Earlier, I said that the |, \*, and + forms we added to our grammar metasyntax were just syntactic sugar. Take this grammar:

```
expr â†’ expr ( "(" ( expr ( "," expr )* )? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )+
     | IDENTIFIER
     | NUMBER
```

Produce a grammar that matches the same language but does not use any of that notational sugar.

Bonus: What kind of expression does this bit of grammar encode?

## Answer

1. **Similar grammar**

expr -> IDENTIFIER
expr -> NUMBER

expr -> expr methodCall
expr -> expr fieldAccess

methodCall -> "(" ")"
methodCall -> "(" parameterList ")"

parameterList -> expr
parameterList -> expr "," parameterList

fieldAccess -> "." IDENTIFIER
