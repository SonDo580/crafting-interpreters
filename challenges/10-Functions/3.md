## Challenge 10.3

Is this program valid?

```
fun scope(a) {
  var a = "local";
}
```

In other words, are a functionâ€™s parameters in the same scope as its local variables, or in an outer scope? What does Lox do? What about other languages you are familiar with? What do you think a language should do?

## Answer

- The program is totally valid. It prints 'local'.
- The function's parameters are in the same scope as its local variables (check `LoxFunction.call` and `Interpreter.executeBlock`)
- It's the same in JavaScript

## Explain

- The `Environment.define` method allows re-definition of variables within the same scope.
- For functions: local variables are defined after parameter-argument bindings, so they can overwrite definitions with the same names.
