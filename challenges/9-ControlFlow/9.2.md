## Challenge 9.2

Likewise, looping can be implemented using those same tools, provided our interpreter supports an important optimization. What is it, and why is it necessary? Name a language that uses this technique for iteration.

## Answer

1. **Implement looping with first-class functions**

The optimization needed is `Tail Call Optimization`

- allow a function to call another function as its final action without keeping the current function's frame on the call stack
- the most common use is `Tail Recursion`, where a recursive function can use constant stack space

2. **Example with Scheme**

```scheme
(define (factorial x)
  (define (factorial-iter x accumulator)
    (if (= x 0)
        accumulator
        (factorial-iter (- x 1)
                        (* x accumulator))))
  (factorial-iter x 1))
```
