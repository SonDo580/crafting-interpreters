## Challenge 9.1

A few chapters from now, when Lox supports first-class functions and dynamic dispatch, we technically wonâ€™t need branching statements built into the language. Show how conditional execution can be implemented in terms of those. Name a language that uses this technique for its control flow.

## Answer

1. **Implement conditional execution with first-class function**

- Define 'true' and 'false' as functions:

```
true = (then, else) => then();
false = (then, else) => else();
```

- Define 'if' as a function:

```
if = (condition, then, else) => condition(then, else);
```

- Usage:

```
condition = true;
then = () => print("true");
else = () => print("false");
if(condition, then, else);
```

2. **Example with Scheme**

```scheme
;; Define functions
(define (true then else)
    (then))

(define (false then else)
    (else))

(define (if condition then else)
    (condition then else))

;; Usage
(define condition true)

(define then (lambda () (display "true.\n")))

(define else (lambda () (display "false.\n")))

(if condition then else)
```
